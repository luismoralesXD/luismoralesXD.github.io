          <h3>Completing application forms.</h3>
          <p>Filling out some job applications can take longer then others. It is important to know how long the one for the job you are applying for will take and giving yourself enough time to not rush. Doing otherwise might lead you to making mistakes, some of which might be worse than others.</p>
          <p>Depending on if the application is in paper or if it is online, having multiple copies of the application ones can be handy. We make mistakes sometimes and they will show on paper. Having multiple copies helps us use one for a rough draft and any mistakes made can simly be fixed and will show up more cleaner when transferred. Now if the application is online, there is no need to worry with mistakes as they can simply be delete with a click of a key.</p>
          <p>Understanding what the question is asking is also important. If for whatever reason you are confused with what the question means of how to fill it out, you should ask someone who works there or give the place a call to clear up any confusion. More helpful links can be found below.</p>
