      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 2014 movie, Paddington, a Peruvian bear with the ability to talk English, decides to travel to London in search of a home after his grandfather dies in a storm. Once he is in London, he has a hard time to fit in. Only
        after a nice lady comes up to him does he finally have someplace to sleep for the night. Throughout the movie, he does not try to change how he acts to just fit in or be more like a human than who he really is.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes sense to say that if someone tries to imitate someone else, not only does it destroy their own identity, but also anything that belongs to them, their culture, history, personality, etc.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddington is already special, he is a bear that can walk on two legs, understand humans, speak their language and has his own unique thinking. For him to try to be more human, simply because he lives in a city, would ruin 
        his true self. The bear he is, his real identity.

      <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunger games takes place in a time when there are seven districts, each with their own industry, run by one man in power that lives in what they call The Capital, where only the rich live. Each year 2 contestants from each district must compete 
        against each other to the death. The residents of these districts must live under the full control of the president while those in the capital enjoy a prosperous life.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoreau's quote can reflect on how governments that control people the most, is not the best for the people, but is the best for those in power. People do not need to rely on a government to live their everyday life.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who live in these districts must work their butts off and worry every year if they themselves or their loved ones must take part in the deadly competition. And the sole purpose of this competition is not to benefit those working, but to
        keep the power in the hands of those already in power and have the districts continue being seperated with conflicts. Only until they put their differences apart and come as one to stand up against the government, will they be able to have a better life.
