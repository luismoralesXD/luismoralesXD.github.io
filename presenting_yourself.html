          <h3>How to present yourself in a job interview</h3>
          <p>Having a good background and being highly qualified for a job doesn't always guarantee you will get employed. If the person doing the hiring has two equally qualified people, and one is more prepared, more committed, and with the better personality, its easy to guess who will be the one hired. You have to stand out to the employer and make them want you over the next person coming to be interviewed as well.</p>
          <p>Appearance is one of those factors. Of course not all jobs require Suits and fancy clothes, but you do not want to show up in your pijamas either. Just because the job you are interviewing for does not have a high expectation on clothing, one should still be well dressed.</p>
          <p>Confidence is another of these factors. Be relaxed when being interviewed, show you are hard to crack. For more tips, checkout some of the following links.</p>
